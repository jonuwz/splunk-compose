STARTING
========
./prep.sh   ( one time only to create certs and config )

docker compose up -d

WHAT
====

This demonstrates splunk using SAML as an authentication strategy

This uses :
keycloak (an opensource idp sponsored by redhat)
splunk 
openldap

NOTES
=====
Splunk sends signed SAML requests to keycloak
Keycloak verifies the signiture.
Keycloak sends signed documents back to splunk
Splunk verifies the signature.

In order to do this we need to prepare some certificates + keys ahead of time

LOGGING IN
==========

Log into keycloak at http://localhost:9080   (admin/password)
Log into splunk using http://localhost:9000  (splunkadmin/password)

Bypass splunk SAML using http://localhost:9000/account/login?loginType=splunk ( admin/password )

For other users - see resources/ldap-ldif/main.ldif

BEWARE
======
The SAML dance happens in your browser.
Splunk doesnt talk to keycloak directly.
The redirect URIs *WILL* break if you alter the exposed ports the containers listen on

FUN STUFF
=========

For more security, enable MFA with one-time-passcodes

1. log into keycloak
2. Browse to the apps domain
3. Authentication -> Flows -> Browser
4. Set 'Browser -> Conditional OTP' to 'Required'
5. Log out and in of splunk

You will need to register the app in Microsoft authenticator on your mobile.
Its as simple as scanning a barcode.
