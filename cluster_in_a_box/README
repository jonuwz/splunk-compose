Cluster in a box
================

This stands up a cluster master and 2 indexers. Search and replication factor is 2

Optionally stands up search heads

Requirements
============

Your local /var/run/docker.sock MUST be writable by the ansible user in the container

Running
=======

Just the indexer cluster :

docker compose up -d

With a search head :

docker compose --profile sh up -d 

With a search head cluster :

docker compose --profile shc1 up -d

Increse number of search heads to 3 :

docker compose --profile shc1 up --no-recreate --scale shc1=3 -d

Connecting
==========

Splunk UI is available on http://localhost:8000
Splunkd is available on https://localhost:8089

Cluster master UI is available on http://localhost:8900
Cluster master splunkd is available on http://localhost:8989

Deploying
=========

Cluster master:

Cluster masters /opt/splunk/etc/master-apps will be bind mounted to ./resources/master-apps
If ./resources/master-apps is empty, the _cluster app will be copied from the container

This will be preserved across container destruction. Be sure to remove the contents if you change versions.

To apply a bundle

docker exec --user splunk s-cm1-1 /opt/splunk/bin/splunk apply cluster-bundle -auth admin:password --answer-yes

Deployer :

If using an search head cluster, the deployers /opt/splunk/etc/shcluster/apps will be bind mounted to ./resources/shcluster/apps

This will be preserved across container destruction. Be sure to remove the contents if you want a clean start

To apply a bundle

docker exec --user splunk s-shc1-1 /opt/splunk/bin/splunk apply shcluster-bundle -target https://s-shc-1:8089 -auth admin:password --answer-yes
